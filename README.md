# WLib

The standard C++ library used by Waterloop. 

WLib is built in-house for our pod's embedded systems. The goal of WLib is to create a lighter and safer alternative to C++ STL. WLib is more memory efficient, has a smaller binary footprint, and has low power consumption. WLib uses controlled heap memory or a static memory pool, which prevents fragmentation.

This library depends only on a few C standard libraries and is optimized for embedded systems that have less memory and low processing power.

For more details check out our [documentation](https://teamwaterloop.github.io/waterloop-wlib/).
